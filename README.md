# Lazy loading the compiler.

A small POC for lazy loading the compiler while using AOT compilation for the main bundle.

- Run the app (`npm run start`) and open it in the browser
- Open `network` tab on your dev-tools window.
- Click on the **Lazy** menu. 
- See the compiler lazy load in the `network` tab
- Click on the `Add` button to compile and instantiate a component on the fly.
